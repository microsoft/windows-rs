# How are these crates built?

The [windows](https://crates.io/crates/windows) and [windows-sys](https://crates.io/crates/windows-sys) crates are generated from metadata describing the Windows API. Originally only WinRT APIs included metadata, but metadata is now provided for older C and COM APIs as well. The [win32metadata](https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/) project provides the tools to produce the metadata and the [windows-metadata](https://crates.io/crates/windows-metadata) and [windows-bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/windows-bindgen) crates are used to read the metadata and generate the `windows` and `windows-sys` crates. The bindings are generated differently based on the differing goals of the respective crates. You can find the exact metadata files used to generate a particular version of the `windows` and `windows-sys` crates [here](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/master/crates/libs/bindgen/default).
