# Getting Started with Rust

The [windows-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs) project has been available for some time and while I still have a great deal of work left to do, I thought I should start spending some time writing about Rust for Windows and not simply building Rust for Windows. ðŸ˜Š As I did for [C++/WinRT](https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt), I thought I would start writing a few short "how to" or "how it works" articles to help developers understand some of the fundamentals of the [windows-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs) project.

Some of these topics will be obvious for Rust developers but perhaps not the Windows developer new to Rust. Other topics might be obvious to Windows developers but less so to the seasoned Rust developer new to Windows. Either way, I hope you find it useful. Feel free to [open an issue on the repo](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues) if you have any questions.
