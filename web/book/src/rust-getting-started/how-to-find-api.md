# How do I find a particular API?

First [pick the crate you would like to use](windows-or-windows-sys.md). Then search the documentation for the chosen crate:

- [windows](https://microsoft.github.io/windows-docs-rs/)

- [windows-sys](https://docs.rs/windows-sys)

Note that the docs include a note indicating which features to enable in order to access a particular API.
