/// * The associated type `Abi` must be safe to transfer over FFI boundaries (e.g., it must have a stable layout)
///     * The type must also be trivially droppable. For non-trivially droppable types consider wrapping in `ManuallyDrop`.
///       This ensures that when the type is passed over an FFI boundary, the `Drop` impl is not called.
/// * It must be legal for `Abi` to be all zeros
///     * This allows for outparams across the FFI boundary to be initialized as zero.
/// * `from_abi` must be implemented if there are any in-memory representations of `Abi` that are not valid representations of `Self`.
///     * `from_abi` must then check for this illegal representations and return an error if they are found.
///     * For example, since `Abi` can be all zeros, if `Self` cannot be, then `from_abi` must check for all zeros and return an error if found.
