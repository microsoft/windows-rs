## Windows services

The [windows-services](https://crates.io/crates/windows-services) crate provides a simple and safe way to implement Windows services in Rust.

* [Getting started](https://kennykerr.ca/rust-getting-started/)
* [Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/master/crates/samples)
* [Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/releases)

Start by adding the following to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies.windows-services]
version = "0.24"
```

Use the Windows services support as needed. Here is how you might write a simple Windows services process:

```rust,no_run
fn main() {
    windows_services::Service::new()
        .can_pause()
        .can_stop()
        .run(|service, command| {
            // Respond to service commands...
        })
        .unwrap();
}
```
