   = note: the method `quote_into_iter` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `std::net::Ipv4Addr: std::iter::Iterator`
           which is required by `std::net::Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepIteratorExt`
           `&std::net::Ipv4Addr: std::iter::Iterator`
           which is required by `&std::net::Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepIteratorExt`
           `std::net::Ipv4Addr: quote::to_tokens::ToTokens`
           which is required by `std::net::Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepToTokensExt`
           `&mut std::net::Ipv4Addr: std::iter::Iterator`
           which is required by `&mut std::net::Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepIteratorExt`
   = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
