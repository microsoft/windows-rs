Many of the samples were inspired or originally appeared in Kenny's [articles](https://kennykerr.ca/articles/) and [courses on Pluralsight](https://kennykerr.ca/courses/). 

The samples in the repo compile with the latest, usually pre-release, version of the `windows` or `windows-sys` crate. 
To find the samples for a particular release you can use a specific release tag. For example:

https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/0.45.0/crates/samples

That will give you the samples that compile with version 0.45.0 of the `windows` and `windows-sys` crates.
