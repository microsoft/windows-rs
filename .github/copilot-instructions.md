# Copilot Instructions for windows-rs

Read this file at the start of every session. It contains the essential commands, conventions, and
architecture knowledge needed to work on this repository.

## Workflow

Do not create git commits automatically. The maintainer reviews all changes first and handles
commits manually. Make changes locally, run fmt/clippy/tests to verify, and report back.

## Repository Layout

Cargo workspace (`resolver = "3"`). Members are globbed from:

- `crates/libs/*` - the published/library crates (`windows`, `windows-sys`, `windows-core`, plus
  `windows-bindgen`, `metadata`, `rdl`, and the newer `reactor`/`canvas`/`webview`/`window` crates).
  See `docs/readme.md` for the full categorized crate index, and `docs/crates/<crate>.md` per crate.
- `crates/tools/*` - code generators and CI helpers, run via `cargo run -p tool-*`.
- `crates/tests/*/*` - test crates; `crates/tests/libs/<crate>` mirrors each library crate (e.g.
  `test_reactor`, `test-webview`). Crate names are `test_<dir>`.
- `crates/samples/*/*` - runnable examples.

The crates fall into rough groups (see `docs/readme.md` for the authoritative list): core & errors
(`windows-core`, `windows-result`, `windows-strings`); values & collections (`numerics`,
`collections`, `reference`, `time`); async & threading (`future`, `threading`); system services
(`registry`, `services`, `version`); COM macros & linking (`implement`, `interface`, `link`); UI &
graphics (`reactor`, `canvas`, `webview`, `window`, `animation`, `reactor-setup`); codegen &
metadata tooling (`bindgen`, `metadata`, `rdl`, `cppwinrt`); and the full API projection (`windows`,
`windows-sys`).

## Before Finalizing Changes

```sh
cargo fmt --all
```

CI enforces rustfmt. Always format before finalizing changes. On Windows, the workspace-wide
command may exceed the process command-line limit; use `cargo fmt -p <crate>` for each affected
crate instead.

## Build & Test Commands

### Core crates

```sh
cargo check -p windows-core --quiet
cargo check -p windows --quiet
cargo clippy -p <crate> --all-targets
cargo test -p <crate>

# Run a single test by name filter
cargo test -p <crate> <test_name_substring>
```

CI sets `RUSTFLAGS: -D warnings`, so any warning fails the build. Workspace-wide lints are
configured in the root `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.lints]`) - clippy lints like
`uninlined_format_args`, `redundant_clone`, and `semicolon_if_nothing_returned` are promoted to
warnings and therefore enforced.

### Reactor

```sh
# Regenerate codegen (after editing winui.toml or tool-reactor source)
cargo run -p tool-reactor --quiet

# Regenerate bindings (after editing filter .txt files)
cargo run -p tool-bindings --quiet

# Verify reactor compiles
cargo check -p windows-reactor --quiet

# Unit tests (headless, fast)
cargo test -p test_reactor --quiet

# Integration tests (launches WinUI window)
cargo run -p test-reactor-selftest
cargo run -p test-reactor-selftest -- --headless    # CI mode
cargo run -p test-reactor-selftest -- --filter Name  # single fixture

# Clippy
cargo clippy -p windows-reactor --all-targets
```

### Canvas

```sh
cargo check -p windows-canvas --quiet
cargo test -p windows-canvas --quiet
cargo clippy -p windows-canvas --all-targets
```

### Full workspace

```sh
cargo run -p tool-clippy-all    # runs clippy across all crates
```

## Code Generation Pipeline

**Never hand-edit generated files.** Generated outputs are committed, and CI fails if regenerating
produces a diff (the `gen` workflow runs each `cargo run -p tool-*` and rejects any change; the
`test` workflow likewise fails if tests modify tracked files). After editing generators or filters,
re-run the tool and commit the result.

The core `windows` / `windows-sys` crates are generated from Windows metadata (`.winmd`) via
`windows-bindgen` (driven by `tool-package`). `windows-metadata` and `windows-rdl` support
reading/authoring that metadata. The reactor / canvas / webview pipelines layer on top:

1. **`tool-reactor`** - reads `crates/tools/reactor/src/winui.toml` + WinUI `.winmd` metadata ->
   generates `generated.rs`, `generated_set_prop.rs`, `generated_attach_event.rs`, and
   `generated.txt` filter entries.

2. **`tool-bindings`** - reads filter `.txt` files from `crates/tools/bindings/src/` -> runs
   `windows-bindgen` -> generates `bindings.rs` in each crate:
   - `crates/libs/canvas/src/bindings.rs` (from `canvas.txt`)
   - `crates/libs/time/src/bindings.rs`, `numerics`, `reference`, etc.

3. **`tool-package`** - generates the published `windows` and `windows-sys` package crates using
   `--package` mode (per-namespace files + Cargo.toml features).

4. After regenerating, always verify: `cargo check -p <affected-crate> --quiet`

## Key Architecture Facts

### Crate relationships

- `windows-core` is the foundation - almost everything depends on it.
- `windows` is the umbrella crate that re-exports from `windows-core`, `windows-numerics`,
  `windows-time`, `windows-collections`, `windows-reference`, etc.
- `windows-reactor` depends on `windows-core` (not `windows`) and uses minimal bindings generated
  with `--minimal --flat` mode.
- `windows-canvas` similarly uses minimal bindings for D2D/DXGI/DWrite/WIC.
- `windows-animation` wraps Win32 UIAnimation Manager COM APIs.

### Reactor architecture

- WinUI backend is in `crates/libs/reactor/src/backend/winui/`.
- The TOML config (`winui.toml`) declares ~52 WinUI controls. Keys are WinUI metadata names; the
  tool infers types, setter patterns, and event handlers from `.winmd` files.
- COM casts: classes Deref to their default interface (zero-cost). Only cast to non-default parent
  interfaces. The `Param` trait handles parent-class conversions automatically.

### Canvas architecture

- Canvas wraps D2D/DXGI behind safe Rust types (`GpuDevice`, `SwapChain`, `DrawingSession`,
  `PathBuilder`).
- `animated_canvas()` (reactor feature) renders on UI thread via `CompositionTarget::Rendering`.
- Device-lost recovery is automatic.

## Conventions

- **Panics**: Use `panic!` only for invariant violations. Use `diag::` helpers for missing features
  (warn in debug, no-op in release).
- **`.unwrap()` over `.expect("...")`** - the panic hook provides full context.
- **No `thread_local!` in app code** - use reactor hooks (`use_state`, `use_ref`) instead.
  `thread_local!` is reserved for framework plumbing.
- **Test naming**: Unit tests in `test_reactor`, integration tests in `test-reactor-selftest`.
  Canvas tests use WARP software rendering.

## Documentation

The `docs/` folder has one page per crate:

- **`docs/crates/<crate>.md`** - a single page per crate covering both usage and internals (how the
  crate is built and maintained: codegen pipeline, generated files, conventions). It links to the
  crate's own `readme.md` for the user-facing intro and quick example.
- **`crates/libs/<crate>/readme.md`** - the user-facing introduction with a quick example (also the
  crates.io / docs.rs landing).
- **`docs/readme.md`** - the documentation hub and crate index.

`docs/` also holds `contributing.md`, `code_of_conduct.md`, and `security.md`.

When making changes to a crate, update its `docs/crates/<crate>.md` page and its `readme.md` as
needed. For example, `windows-reactor` changes touch `docs/crates/windows-reactor.md` (codegen,
TOML, threading, COM pitfalls, plus the conceptual overview) and `crates/libs/reactor/readme.md`
(getting started and the quick example).

## Writing Style for Docs and Comments

These rules were established while cleaning up the docs and code comments and apply to all Markdown
(`.md`) and Rust comments/doc-comments across the repo. Keep new writing consistent with them.

- **ASCII punctuation only.** Use `-` for dashes (never em/en-dashes), `...` for ellipsis, `->` for
  arrows, `<=`/`>=`/`!=` for comparisons, and straight quotes. Drop the section sign from standard
  references (write `ECMA-335 II.22`, `C11 6.4.4.1`, not `\u00a7...`). The only non-ASCII that stays
  is genuine test data (e.g. a Greek-letter string literal exercising UTF-8 handling).
- **100-column wrap.** Hard-wrap Markdown prose and long comment blocks at 100 columns. Keep the
  wrap consistent within a file - do not mix wrapped and unwrapped paragraphs.
- **No LLM tells.** Avoid the vocabulary and tics that mark agent-written text: `faithful`,
  `corpus`, `ledger`, `crucially`, `notably`, `essentially`, `robust`, `seamless`, `comprehensive`,
  `deliberately`, `simply`, `under the hood`, `that said`, `importantly`, `conceptually`,
  `effectively`, `single source of truth`, `industry-standard`, `first-class`, `leverage`,
  `utilize`, `Note that ...`. Say the concrete thing instead. `ergonomic` and rustdoc `**bold**` are
  fine.
- **No decorative formatting.** No box-drawing banner comments (`// -- Title ------`), no duplicated
  doc paragraphs (a real copy-paste tell), no filler that restates the code.
- **Prefer tables over wordy paragraphs** where the content is a set of parallel cases (rules,
  mappings, options).
- **Describe the code as it is,** not its history. Avoid churn narration (`used to`, `previously`,
  `an earlier version`, `no longer`) unless it describes real runtime behavior, not codebase edits.
- **Do not edit generated files** to satisfy these rules; only hand-written sources.

## Open Investigations / TODO

Enduring record of known issues so they are not lost between sessions. Add findings here; remove or
mark done as they are addressed. Cite code by file + symbol name, not line number - line numbers go
stale fast.

### Repo-wide dead-code / quality audit (2026-07)

Open items across the hand-written crates (reactor, bindgen, rdl, clang, canvas, metadata, webview,
core) that need a design decision or a larger change. Any bindgen source change must be proven
output-neutral by running the `tool-*` generators and confirming `git diff` shows no generated-file
changes (the `gen` workflow enforces this).

#### Duplication / refactor candidates

| Location | Issue |
| --- | --- |
| `metadata` `merge/mod.rs` `write_type` vs `merge/remap.rs` `write_type` | Two ~60-line structurally identical functions; the remap copy's comment says it mirrors `merge::write_type`. Any new ECMA table must be added to both, with no compiler guard. |
| `canvas` `session.rs` gradient-stop + bitmap-properties builders | Duplicated ABI-stop and bitmap-properties construction across the brush paths. |
| `bindgen` `types/interface.rs` + `cpp_interface.rs` local `fn combine` | Duplicate local helper. |
| `canvas` `color.rs` `DARK_SLATE_BLUE` | `rgb(0.05, 0.05, 0.1)` does not match the CSS color of that name (public API used by samples). |

#### Coverage gaps

| Area | Gap |
| --- | --- |
| `metadata` `Remapper` (`merge/remap.rs`) | No tests anywhere; routing/`split_apis` logic is exercised only in the live build, so a regression yields a malformed namespaced winmd with no failing test. |
| webview | `process-failed`, download, and deferral paths untested. |
