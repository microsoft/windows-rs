# windows-bindgen2

`windows-bindgen2` is an unpublished replacement candidate for
[`windows-bindgen`](windows-bindgen.md). It uses
[`windows-metadata2`](windows-metadata2.md) directly and is developed beside the current generator
so every output layer can be compared before migration.

## Design constraints

- Own the metadata database; do not leak it.
- Store typed metadata entities rather than copied names or borrowed rows.
- Keep selection, dependency closure, projection, rendering, and output layout separate.
- Build indexes only for measured lookup requirements.
- Lower methods, delegates, interfaces, and classes one item at a time.
- Keep only the recursive value graph global.
- Return structured errors rather than using malformed-input panics.
- Require deterministic output and differential tests at every checkpoint.

## Progress

The first layer selects WinRT enums and structs from an owned database. API-contract marker structs
are excluded as bindgen policy. Construction uses temporary namespace/name sort keys, then discards
them and stores only typed `TypeDef` entities and value categories. Iteration resolves short-lived
semantic views through the owned database and is deterministic by namespace, name, file, and row.

This intentionally does not reproduce the old reader map. Exact-name lookup already belongs to
`windows-metadata2::Database`; bindgen2 has no measured need for another permanent name index.

The value layer lowers all 1,731 selected enums and 125 structs into owned models. Enum, struct,
type, GUID, and graph policy live in separate modules. The graph uses nested ordered maps so
namespace and type lookups borrow existing strings rather than allocating lookup keys. It detects
recursive value cycles and conflicting GUID definitions explicitly.

Every selected value now renders successfully. Focused enum and struct fixtures match the existing
golden output token for token. `HttpProgress`, the one gap in the earlier bindgen-side proof, now
uses its parameterized `IReference<u64>` interface signature. GUID folding remains bindgen
projection policy and is performed only for generic named types that require it.

The first flat Win32 slice selects 83,641 constants and 14,559 functions from non-WinRT `Apis`
containers. Selection stores one namespace string per container plus typed field and method
entities; per-item namespace copies would have been expensive at this scale. Temporary names are
used only for deterministic sorting.

All 14,559 functions lower through a separate native signature model. The supported surface
includes primitive and named types, const and mutable pointers, symbol aliases, C and system
calling conventions, and variadic declarations. Focused no-parameter and const-pointer functions
match existing flat sys tokens.

Of the constants, 65,345 lower directly, including primitive, pointer-sized, UTF-16, and ANSI
string values. Focused primitive and string constants match existing flat sys tokens. The remaining
constant inventory is exact:

| Shape | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Native typedef conversion | 15,040 |
| Special field without a Constant row | 3,256 |

Selection, native types, constants, and functions are separate modules. Unsupported constant
shapes return errors and are counted by a corpus test rather than disappearing from output.

## Next checkpoint

Model native typedef identity and underlying types so typed constants can be rendered without
pulling in the old `CppStruct` graph. Inventory the 3,256 special constants before deciding whether
GUID/property-key constants belong in the same layer.
