## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or
contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Before Contributing

While this project welcomes contributions, that process begins by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues/new/choose)
or [commenting on an existing issue](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues) to discuss a feature suggestion or bug fix.
This allows project owners and maintainers to discuss ideas and potentially offer alternative solutions. It also offers an
opportunity for frequent contributors and other experts to chime in with suggestions. This discussion is vital so that we
can agree on an approach before you invest a large amount of time working on a pull request. This is why the
[pull request template](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) reminds you
to refer to an existing issue.
