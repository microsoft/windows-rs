## Rust for Windows

The [windows](https://crates.io/crates/windows) and [windows-sys](https://crates.io/crates/windows-sys) crates let you call any Windows API past, present, and future using code generated on the fly directly from the [metadata describing the API](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/master/crates/libs/bindgen/default) and right into your Rust package where you can call them as if they were just another Rust module. The Rust language projection follows in the tradition established by [C++/WinRT](https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt) of building language projections for Windows using standard languages and compilers, providing a natural and idiomatic way for Rust developers to call Windows APIs.
